# Everli Hiring Process - Task 3

### Language

Javascript/HTML/CSS

### Description

From the app you wrote for Task 2, add a categories list that acts as a filter. When a filter is clicked, all posts should be filtered based on the chosen category.
Consider also adding a `show all` filter to return to the default state.

You can find all the categories performing a GET on this endpoint:
`http://www.mocky.io/v2/5c43503a3800006f00072e08`
Also provide a toggle button ordering the posts by descending `published_at`. The result should be usable from any device.

### Submition

Send us the complete project compressed and named 'rest-list.zip'.
